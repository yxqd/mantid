    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

- Added time standard deviation to the sample log dialog

Installation
------------
Changes
#######
The following changes have been made _only_ on Windows, bringing it in line with Mantid's installation naming on Linux.

- The Mantid Nightly build will now be installed in a different directory by default, to avoid overwriting the release Mantid installation.
- The Mantid Nightly build desktop and start menu shortcuts will have the "Nightly" suffix appended, to distinguish from the release Mantid installation.

Project Recovery
----------------
New
###
- Project recovery can now make a recovery checkpoint on command using mantidplot.app.saveRecoveryCheckpoint() in either the interpreter or script windows in python
- If project recovery fails when attempting to recover a checkpoint it will open a new GUI offering multiple checkpoints to the user and the ability to open them in a script window. (See image below)

- Project Recovery can now make a recovery checkpoint on command using mantidplot.app.saveRecoveryCheckpoint() in either the interpreter or script windows in python
- Project Recovery now adds a lock file at the start of saving so if MantidPlot crashes when saving it will no longer use that checkpoint as it is incomplete.
- Project Recovery now has the ability to be changed from inside of MantidPlot without using the config files directly, this can be found in view->preferences->mantid->projectrecovery


Changes
#######
- Project Recovery will no longer save groups, this fixes an issue where it would cause crashes if you deleted a workspace from a group.
- MantidPlot no longer checks for the existence of files in the "Recent Files" menu. Fixes case where files on slow mounted network drives can cause a lag on MantidPlot startup.
- Workspaces now save locally as a number of how many workspaces have already been saved instead of workspace names
- Project Recovery will now attempt to recover multiple instances of mantid that are ran at the same time.
- The project recovery prompt on mantid restart is improved and shows which checkpoint you will be getting. (See image below)

- Project Recovery will now output less unhelpful logging information into the results log


Bugfixes
########
- Workspaces with a '#' in their name will no longer cause issues in the loading of a recovered project
- Project Recovery will actually recover fully cases where multiple workspaces were passed as a list to an algorithm (Fixes a known bug with GroupWorkspaces as well)
- Project Recovery will now run normally when you select no or the recovery fails when recovering from a ungraceful exit.
- When autosaving or saving a recovery checkpoint with the Instrument View open the results log would be filled with excess logging and no longer does this.
- Fixed an issue where Project Recovery would start regardless of the config options
- Project recovery will now successfully recover live data, it will however be unable to recover any data that was up at the time, but will start the live data streams again from scratch.
- If an empty group workspace is present in the ADS it will no longer crash the save thread of project recovery and instead will delete it from the ADS and ignore it.

MantidPlot
----------

Changes
#######

- All File Browser dialog boxes will now (by default) display all valid file extensions as the first file filter.

BugFixes
########

- Fixed issue where an open set of data from ITableWorkspace wouldn't update if the data was changed via python
- Fixed an issue where MantidPlot would crash when renaming workspaces.
